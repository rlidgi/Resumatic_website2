    <h2 class="mb-4">Resume Summary vs. Objective: Which Should You Use in 2025?</h2>

    <p><strong>Intro:</strong><br>
      Many resumes begin with a brief statement at the top — either a summary or an objective. But which one belongs on
      your resume in 2025? Here's how to choose wisely and make a strong first impression in a competitive job market.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What is a Resume Objective?</strong><br>
      A resume objective is a short statement of your career goals. It focuses on what <em>you</em> want from the
      employer. Example:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0">"To obtain a marketing position where I can grow my skills and contribute to the team."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Objectives used to be standard, but today they are only useful in very specific contexts. They're most helpful
      when you're at the beginning of your career or transitioning into a new field. The key is to make the objective
      specific and aligned with the role you're applying for.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What is a Resume Summary?</strong><br>
      A resume summary is a brief overview of your top achievements, experiences, and skills. It tells the employer what
      you bring to the table. Example:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0">"Results-driven marketer with 3+ years of experience improving campaign ROI by 40%. Skilled in
        SEO, SEM, and data analytics."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This format is powerful because it immediately positions you as a value-added candidate. It’s your elevator pitch
      — short, sharp, and persuasive.</p>

    <p><strong>When to Use a Summary:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-group mb-4">
      <li class="list-group-item">You have relevant experience in the industry</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">You want to highlight measurable results</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">You're applying to a job that closely matches your background</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>When to Use an Objective:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-group mb-4">
      <li class="list-group-item">You're a student or recent graduate</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">You're making a career change</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">You're entering the job market after a long gap</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Best Practice for 2025:</strong><br>
      If you have any relevant work or project experience, opt for a summary. Objectives are acceptable only if you have
      little else to lead with. Even then, make it specific and professional.
