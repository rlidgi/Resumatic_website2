        <h1 class="mb-4">Top 10 Resume Mistakes to Avoid (and How to Fix Them)</h1>

        <p>Your resume is your first impression—it can open the door to an interview or quietly close it. But even the
            most qualified professionals can make costly mistakes that prevent them from getting noticed. Whether you're
            applying for your first job or making a career shift, avoiding these common pitfalls will help your resume
            stand out for the right reasons.</p>

        <p>Here are the <strong>10 most common resume mistakes</strong> and how to avoid them:</p>

        <hr>
        <h3><strong>1. Spelling and Grammar Errors</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Hiring managers see typos as signs of carelessness.<br>
            <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Use spellcheck, then proofread manually. Ask someone else to review or run
            it through a tool like Grammarly.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><strong>2. Using One Generic Resume for All Jobs</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Recruiters can tell when you’ve submitted a cookie-cutter resume.<br>
            <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Tailor your resume to each job. Match your skills and experience to the job
            description—especially in the top third of your resume.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><strong>3. Including Irrelevant Work Experience</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Cluttered resumes dilute your message.<br>
            <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Only include roles that are directly relevant or show transferable skills.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><strong>4. Not Quantifying Achievements</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> “Responsible for managing a team” is vague; numbers provide proof.<br>
            <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Use metrics to show impact, like “Led a team of 5 and increased delivery
            speed by 30%.”
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><strong>5. Poor Formatting</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A messy resume is hard to read and may be skipped.<br>
            <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Use a clean, professional layout with consistent fonts and section headers.
            Avoid flashy visuals.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><strong>6. Overusing Buzzwords</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Words like “go-getter” or “synergy” can seem hollow.<br>
            <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Replace them with concrete actions and real results.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><strong>7. Making It Too Long (or Too Short)</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Recruiters spend 6–8 seconds on a first scan.<br>
            <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Keep to 1 page if early in your career, max 2 pages for experienced
            professionals.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><strong>8. Ignoring ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If your resume isn’t ATS-friendly, it may never be read.<br>
            <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Use standard headers like “Experience,” avoid graphics, and include keywords
            from the job post.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><strong>9. Leaving Out a Summary or Objective (When Appropriate)</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A summary clarifies your goals and value.<br>
            <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Add a concise professional summary that highlights your strengths.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3><strong>10. Including Personal Information</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Personal details like age or marital status can lead to bias.<br>
            <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Stick to name, email, phone, LinkedIn, and optionally a portfolio or GitHub.
        </p>
