        <h1 class="mb-4">How to Tailor Your Resume to a Specific Job Description</h1>

        <p>When it comes to landing interviews, quality matters far more than quantity. One of the biggest mistakes job
            seekers make is sending out the same generic resume for every application. Recruiters can tell instantly
            when you haven’t customized your resume—and that’s often enough to land your application in the “no” pile.
        </p>

        <p>Tailoring your resume to each job description shows you understand the role, meet the qualifications, and are
            serious about the opportunity. Here’s how to do it effectively and efficiently.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>1. <strong>Start With a Solid Master Resume</strong></h2>
        <p>Before you begin tailoring, create a “master resume” that includes all your experience, accomplishments,
            skills, and education. Think of this as your personal database. From here, you can pull the most relevant
            parts for each application.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>2. <strong>Analyze the Job Description Carefully</strong></h2>
        <p>Read the job post word for word. Highlight:</p>
        <ul class="list-group mb-3">
            <li class="list-group-item">Required qualifications</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Preferred skills</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Industry-specific terms</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Responsibilities and duties</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Tools or technologies listed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are your clues. Recruiters and applicant tracking systems (ATS) are scanning for these keywords.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>3. <strong>Match Your Summary to the Role</strong></h2>
        <p>Your professional summary is prime real estate. Customize it to reflect the job title and the most important
            qualifications. For example:</p>
        <p><strong>Generic summary:</strong><br> "Experienced marketing professional skilled in social media and
            analytics."</p>
        <p><strong>Tailored summary:</strong><br> "Data-driven Digital Marketing Specialist with 5+ years of experience
            in SEO, Google Ads, and performance analytics, seeking to drive measurable growth for XYZ Company."</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>4. <strong>Customize Your Skills Section</strong></h2>
        <p>If the job description lists “project management, Salesforce, and cross-functional collaboration,” and you
            have those skills—make sure they’re clearly stated. Don’t just list 20 generic skills; highlight the ones
            mentioned in the post.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>5. <strong>Align Your Experience With Their Priorities</strong></h2>
        <p>For each job on your resume, revise the bullet points to emphasize experiences most relevant to the new role.
            Use similar language to what's in the job ad. For example:</p>
        <p>If the job post says:<br> “Looking for someone with experience improving operational efficiency”</p>
        <p>Then your bullet point might read:<br> “Streamlined team workflows and reduced processing time by 25% through
            new automation tools.”</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>6. <strong>Include Relevant Keywords for ATS</strong></h2>
        <p>Many companies use ATS to filter resumes. If your resume doesn’t include enough matching terms, it may never
            be seen by a person. Use exact wording from the job post where appropriate, especially for:</p>
        <ul class="list-group mb-3">
            <li class="list-group-item">Job titles</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Certifications</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Software or tools</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Key responsibilities</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        <h2>7. <strong>Adjust Job Titles If Needed (Carefully)</strong></h2>
        <p>If your past job title doesn’t clearly reflect your responsibilities, you can adjust it slightly—as long as
            it’s honest. For example:</p>
        <p><strong>Marketing Associate (Marketing Coordinator Duties)</strong></p>

        <hr>
        <h2>8. <strong>Cut What’s Not Relevant</strong></h2>
        <p>You don’t need to include every job you’ve ever had. If a past role doesn’t strengthen your application,
            consider trimming or removing it, especially if you're over the one-page limit.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>9. <strong>Use a Cover Letter to Strengthen the Match</strong></h2>
        <p>Your cover letter is another chance to show how your background aligns with the job. Reinforce your resume
            with a brief explanation of how your experience makes you the perfect fit.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>10. <strong>Final Check: Read It From the Recruiter’s Perspective</strong></h2>
        <p>Ask yourself:</p>
        <ul class="list-group mb-3">
            <li class="list-group-item">Does this resume clearly show I can do this specific job?</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Are the most relevant skills and achievements easy to find?</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Am I speaking their language?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the answer is yes, you’ve tailored your resume effectively.</p>
