    <h2 class="mb-4">How to Write a Resume With No Work Experience</h2>

    <p><strong>Intro:</strong><br>
      Everyone starts somewhere — and that includes writing a resume with no professional
      experience. Whether you’re a student, recent graduate, or changing careers, here’s how to build a
      compelling, high-impact resume from scratch.
    </p>

    <p><strong>1. Start With a Strong Summary</strong><br>
      Use a resume summary to highlight your strongest attributes, your passion, and career goals. Think of this as your
      pitch.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0">
        "Motivated Computer Science graduate with experience in web development through academic projects and
        freelance work. Passionate about front-end design and building user-friendly applications."
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>2. Focus on Education</strong><br>
      List your GPA (if above 3.5), relevant coursework, key projects, certifications, and any academic honors or
      scholarships.
    </p>

    <p><strong>3. Highlight Transferable Skills</strong><br>
      Soft skills like communication, time management, collaboration, and adaptability can still set you apart —
      especially if backed by examples.
    </p>

    <p><strong>4. Add Projects, Internships, and Volunteering</strong><br>
      Include any hands-on experience that shows initiative, leadership, and skill application. Use bullet points to
      outline tasks and accomplishments:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0">
        "Built a mobile app prototype using React Native for a university competition; won 2nd place out of 15 teams."
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>5. Use an ATS-Friendly Format</strong><br>
      Avoid columns and tables. Stick to simple layouts with standard fonts. Use bold headers like "Education,"
      "Projects," "Skills."
    </p>
